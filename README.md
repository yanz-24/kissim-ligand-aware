## ðŸ“Œ Version Information

**Current Stable Version:** `v1.0`  
**Release Date:** 2025-05-06  
**Status:** âœ… Stable and production-ready

### ðŸ”„ Changelog for v1.0
**Added Ligand Distance Feature**:  Introduced a new feature that computes distances between ligands and key residues of kinase pocket

You can check out this version using:
> ```bash
> git checkout tags/v1.0
> ```

---

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Development

Future development is being carried out on the [`dev`](https://github.com/yanz-24/kissim-ligand-aware/tree/dev) branch.

### Planned Features:

  Ligand distance will be integrated into the weighting system â€” it can act either as a scaling weight or as a threshold to include/exclude residue features.



## Description

The `kissim` package offers a novel fingerprinting strategy designed specifically for kinase pockets, 
allowing for similarity studies across the structurally covered kinome. 
The kinase fingerprint is based on the [KLIFS](klifs.net/) pocket alignment, 
which defines 85 pocket residues for all kinase structures. 
This enables a residue-by-residue comparison without a computationally expensive alignment step. 

The pocket fingerprint consists of 85 concatenated residue fingerprints, 
each encoding a residueâ€™s spatial and physicochemical properties. 
The spatial properties describe the residueâ€™s position in relation to the kinase pocket center and 
important kinase subpockets, i.e. the hinge region, the DFG region, and the front pocket. 
The physicochemical properties encompass for each residue its size and pharmacophoric features, solvent exposure and side chain orientation.

Take a look at the [repository `kissim_app`](https://github.com/volkamerlab/kissim_app) for pairwise comparison of all kinases to study kinome-wide similarities.
